# About Red Wine Quality DataSet
# ******************************

*****INDEPENDENT FEATURES

fixed acidity - most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
*************

volatile acidity - the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
****************

citric acid - found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
***********

residual sugar- the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines 
 with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
 **************

chlorides - the amount of salt in the wine
*********

free sulfur dioxide - the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it  prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
*******************

total sulfur dioxide - amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
******************** 

density - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
*******

pH - describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH *** scale

sulphates - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
*********

alcohol - the percent alcohol content of the wine
********
*********DEPENDENT FEATURE

quality - output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)

# Linear-Regression
$ *****************
Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.

In this repository I learned to discover the linear regression algorithm, how it works and how you can best use it in on your machine learning projects. In this post I learned:

*  Why linear regression belongs to both statistics and machine learning.
*  The many names by which linear regression is known.
*  The representation and learning algorithms used to create a linear regression model.
*  How to best prepare your data when modeling using linear regression.
